- https://beltoforion.de/en/recreational_mathematics/game_of_life.php
a really nice website that explains how Conways game of life works and also a way of programming the game with a fixed array (not drawing the array but setting a fixed starting position)
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRWg2SWuXtM&t=134s
a really nice youtube tutorial video that I followed to code the game, this forms the foundation for most of this code and would highly recommend!!

-a living cell dies if it has fewer than two living neighboring cells
-a living cell with two or three living neighbors lives on
-a living cell with more than three living neighboring cells des in the next time step
